# Forkify-App

Final project of Jonas Schmedtman's javascript course.

Forkify-App is a recipe finding application. Here are the main operations;

- Tried to practice async operations with an Api operations. I also had the opportunity to observe the working structure of nested async functions.
- MVC design pattern is used in this application.
- Pub-Sub design pattern is used to communicate between controller
  and view in the application.
- I had the opportunity to use many functions and methods of modern Javascript.
